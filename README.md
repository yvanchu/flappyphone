# Flappy Phone - Why play a bird when you can be the bird?

This project was submitted for Northwestern's Wildhacks 2023, and it is inspired by Flappy Bird and [Das et al's paper on accessing mobile sensors](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243734.3243860). We were also inpsired by Wii Sports games, and we wanted to recreate these more immersive experience on a game that we could've built within 24 hours. Thus we have Flappy Phone, where you play as a bird flying through the city. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [ReactPixi](https://pixijs.io/pixi-react/), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

The current implementation has only been tested on iPhone 8 or newer Apple models.
